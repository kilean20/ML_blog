# 1. Intro

The [variational Bayesian](concept_Bayesian.ipynb)
 approach involves the optimization of variational model to the posterior which is often intractable.
- Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes (SGVB) estimator (of the [variational lower bound](concept_Bayesian.ipynb) using a *reparameterization trick*) enable efficient approximate posterior inference.


- For i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables, the paper propose the Auto-Encoding VB (AEVB a.k.a **VAE**) algorithm.
   - for recognition, denoising, representation purposes.
