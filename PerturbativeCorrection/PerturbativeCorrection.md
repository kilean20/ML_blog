# Perturbative Correction Using ML ( applied on nonlinear decoherence data of beam centroid )
this is part of the contents in [Here](MLdecoherence1.pdf) which a slide presented in IOTA (Accelerator in Fermi Lab) collaboration meeting.

## Data Model 

We assume data to be time series of complex valued scalar. To be more specific, it is simulated measurement data of beam centroid from Beam Position Monitor (BPM). Further details can be found [here](Decoherence.md).
